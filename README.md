# GEN-AI


Welcome to this GitHub repository, a unique blend of generative AI and web development that focuses on extracting data from invoices and images using text recognition.

The application works by building a pipeline using the Gemini Pro API. This pipeline allows for the seamless flow of data from the input (invoices or images) to the output (extracted information). The invoices or images are loaded into the application, and the LLM is then used to extract the relevant information.

A key feature of this application is the use of a specific prompt designed to guide the LLM in extracting the desired information. This prompt is carefully crafted to ensure that the LLM focuses on the relevant parts of the invoice or image, thereby improving the accuracy and relevance of the extracted information.

In conclusion, this repository showcases the power of combining generative AI and web development to create a practical and user-friendly application. It serves as a valuable resource for those interested in text recognition, data extraction, or generative AI. Explore the repository and experience the power of generative AI!
